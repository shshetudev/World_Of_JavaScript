# Case Sensitivity

- In JS, all variables and functions are case sensitive.
- `MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`.
- It is the best practice to write variable names in JS in `camelCase`.
- In `camelCase`, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
- Please see the illustration: [CaseSensitivity](CaseSensitivity.js)
