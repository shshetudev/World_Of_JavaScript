# JS Variables

- **Data:** Data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.
- JS provides eight different data types which are:
  - `undefined`
  - `null`
  - `boolean`
  - `string`
  - `symbol`
  - `bigint`
  - `number`
  - `object`
- __Variables:__ JS variables are containers for storing data values.  
- Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
- They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself.
- Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.
- __In JS, we end statements with semicolons__.
- __Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters or `$` or `_`. But may not contain spaces or start with a number.__
- Please see the illustration: [Variables](Variables.js)

__JS Identifiers:__ All JS variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called __identifiers__.

- The general rules for constructing names for variables are:

  - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  - Names must begin with a letter.
  - Names can also begin with `$` and `.
  - Names are case sensitive.
  - Reserved words (like JS keywords) can not be used as names.

## One Statement, Many Variables

- We can declare many variables in one statement.
- We start the statement with `var` and seperate the variables by comma.
- Please see the illustration: [Variables](Variables.js)

## Value = undefined

- A variable declared without a value will have the value `undefined`.
- Please see the illustration: [Variables](Variables.js)

## Dollar Sign `$`

- A letter (A-Z or a-z).
- A dollar sign ($).
- Or an underscore(_).
